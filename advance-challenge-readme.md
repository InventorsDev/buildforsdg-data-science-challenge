## Hands-on project - (Select One)
- Customer Segmentation for E-commerce: Develop a customer segmentation model to identify groups of customers with similar purchasing behaviors and preferences using data from online transactions. The model should help the business personalize its marketing campaigns and product recommendations and optimize its pricing and inventory strategies.
- Fraud Detection for Financial Services: Develop a fraud detection model to identify potentially fraudulent transactions in real time, using data from credit card transactions or bank transfers. The model should be able to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions and provide alerts or blocks for suspicious transactions to prevent financial losses.
- Object Detection for Autonomous Driving: Develop an object detection model to recognize and classify objects in real-time video data using deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model should be able to help autonomous vehicles navigate complex environments, and avoid obstacles and hazards.
