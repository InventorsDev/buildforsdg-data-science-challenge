Churn Prediction for Telecommunications: Develop a churn prediction model to identify customers who are at risk of canceling their contracts, 
using data from customer interactions, billing, and usage patterns. 
The model should help the business proactively address customer concerns and improve retention rates.

For Telecom companies, it is important to attract new customers and at the same time equally important to avoid contract terminations (i.e. churn)
to grow their revenue generating base. As there are several telecom players in the market, business competition is very high. 
As a result, customers change their service provider for various reasons such as better price offers, more interesting packages, bad service experiences, or change of 
customersâ€™ personal situations.  
I apply machine learning models to predict churn on an individual customer basis and take counter-measures such as discounts, special offers or other 
gratifications to keep their customers.
A customer churn analysis is a typical classification problem within the domain of supervised learning.
