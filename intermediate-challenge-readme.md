### Hands-on Project (Select One)
- Churn Prediction for Telecommunications: Develop a churn prediction model to identify customers who are at risk of canceling their contracts, using data from customer interactions, billing, and usage patterns. The model should help the business proactively address customer concerns and improve retention rates.
- Sentiment Analysis for Social Media: Develop a sentiment analysis model to analyze social media posts and comments and classify them into positive, negative, or neutral categories. The model should help businesses monitor their brand reputation, understand customer feedback, and identify opportunities for improvement.
- Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment: Develop a predictive maintenance model to detect potential equipment failures before they occur, using sensor data from industrial machinery. The model should be able to identify the specific components that are likely to fail and provide recommendations for maintenance actions to prevent unplanned downtime.
